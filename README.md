Hello, I am the creator of PopMod, a mod menu for popcat.click.
I just want to say, the base of this extention is made by mrericwong,
however I have just use the structure of his code as a base and changed
most of it. I am also gonna be changing the icon in case he made that
and its not free clip art. Enjoy!
P.S. This is a chrome extension and not its own program. Go to 
chrome://extensions, enable developer mode and drag the .CRX file
into the window. You must be on chrome, edge, or any other browser
compatible with chrome extensions.
